# Portfolio Profitability Using Actor-Critic Algorithm (RL Course in Financial University)

## Overview
This project compares the profitability of a two-stock portfolio (Microsoft and Boeing) using the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm against the traditional Buy-and-Hold strategy. The goal was to evaluate performance, especially during market turbulence like the COVID-19 crash.

## Key Features
- Implemented Actor-Critic and Buy-and-Hold strategies.
- Analyzed daily stock data (2000â€“2020) with a 0.1% transaction fee.
- Evaluated returns and risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio).

## Results
- **Actor-Critic**: 31% return, Sharpe ratio of 1.07.
- **Buy-and-Hold**: 10% return, Sharpe ratio of 0.75.
- Actor-Critic showed better resilience during market crashes.

## Technologies
- Python, Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic), Yahoo Finance API.
